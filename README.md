### Cancer-Recognition

#### Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations.But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth from the neutral mutations. Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.So I want to develop a Machine Learning algorithm,which uses the text as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations with no latency requirements finds probability of a data-point belonging to each class.

#### Used several algorithms but Naive Bayes Classifier as it is giving good results.
